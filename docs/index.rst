=====
MetPy
=====

MetPy is a collection of tools in Python for reading, visualizing, and
performing calculations with weather data.

MetPy is still in an early stage of development, and as such
**no APIs are considered stable.** While we won't break things
just for fun, many things may still change as we work through
design issues.

We support Python 2.7 as well as Python >= 3.4.
