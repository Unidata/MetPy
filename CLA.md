# About the Contributor License Agreement

Everybody who contributes code to MetPy is going to be asked to sign a
Contributor License Agreement (CLA). MetPy's CLA comes from
[Project Harmony](http://www.harmonyagreements.org), which is a
community-centered group focused on contributor agreements for free and open
source software.

The document you are reading now is not a legal analysis of the CLA. If you
want one of those, please talk to your lawyer. This is a description of the
purpose of the CLA.

## Why is a signed CLA required?

The license agreement is a legal document in which you state you are entitled to
contribute the code/documentation to MetPy and are willing to have it used in
distributions and derivative works. This means that should there be any kind of
legal issue in the future as to the origins and ownership of any particular
piece of code, we have the necessary forms on file from the contributor(s)
saying they were permitted to make this contribution.

The CLA also ensures that once you have provided a contribution, you cannot try
to withdraw permission for its use at a later date. People and companies can
therefore use MetPy, confident that they will not be asked to stop using pieces
of the code at a later date.

Lastly, the CLA gives the MetPy project permission to change the license under
which the project, including the various contributions from many developers, is
distributed in the future. The CLA states that this license needs to be one
that has been approved by the Open Source Initiative, including both copyleft
and permissive licenses. This just gives the freedom to adjust licenses in the
future if needed (e.g. some clause of the current license is found to be invalid).

## Am I giving away the copyright to my contributions?

No. This is a pure license agreement, not a copyright assignment. You still
maintain the full copyright for your contributions. You are only providing a
license to MetPy to distribute your code without further restrictions. This is
not the case for all CLA's, but it is the case for the one we are using.

## What about if I do MetPy development as part of my job?

If any of your contributions to MetPy are created as part of your employment by
somebody else, the work might not actually belong to you. It may be owned by
your employer. In that case, your employer, or somebody able to represent the
company as far as licensing goes, needs to sign the corporate version of the
Contributor Licensing Agreement in order for that contribution to be accepted
into MetPy. They will need to include the names of any developers (you and any
others covered by that agreement) who are able to submit contributions on
behalf of the employer. That list can be updated as new people are employed or
others leave.

You should also still sign an individual CLA in that case. Not all the work you
do will necessarily belong to your employer and we still need permission to
license your individual contributions.

If you have signed an individual CLA, but not a corporate one, be very careful
about submitting contributions you have made. We cannot accept anything that you
do not have the rights to license in the first place and that includes code that
belongs to your employer. Similarly, if you are a consultant who may be creating
MetPy patches as part of a job, make sure you and your employer understand who
owns the rights to the code. Only submit things that you are entitled to. The
CLA is a legal declaration by you that you have the right to grant such a
license for your contributions. It is up to you to make sure that is true.

## Can I withdraw permission to use my contributions at a later date?

No. This is one of the reasons we require a CLA. No individual contributor can hold
such a threat over the entire community of users. Once you make a contribution, you
are saying we can use that piece of code forever.

## Can I submit patches without having signed the CLA?

No. We will be asking all new contributors and patch submitters to sign before
they submit anything.
