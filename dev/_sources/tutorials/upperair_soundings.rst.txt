===========================
Upper Air Sounding Tutorial
===========================

Upper air analysis is a staple of many synoptic and mesoscale analysis
problems. In this tutorial we will gather weather balloon data, plot it,
perform a series of thermodynamic calculations, and summarize the results.
To learn more about the Skew-T diagram and its use in weather analysis and
forecasting, checkout `this <http://www.pmarshwx.com/research/manuals/AF_skewt_manual.pdf>`_
air weather service guide.

Getting Data
------------

Upper air data can be obtained using the siphon package, but for this tutorial we will use
some of MetPy's sample data. This event is the Veterans Day tornado outbreak in 2002.

Thermodynamic Calculations
--------------------------

Often times we will want to calculate some thermodynamic parameters of a
sounding. The MetPy calc module has many such calculations already implemented!

* **Lifting Condensation Level (LCL)** - The level at which an air parcel's
  relative humidity becomes 100% when lifted along a dry adiabatic path.
* **Parcel Path** - Path followed by a hypothetical parcel of air, beginning
  at the surface temperature/pressure and rising dry adiabatically until
  reaching the LCL, then rising moist adiabatially.

    # Calculate the LCL
    lcl_pressure, lcl_temperature = mpcalc.lcl(p[0], T[0], Td[0])

    print(lcl_pressure, lcl_temperature)

    # Calculate the parcel profile.
    parcel_prof = mpcalc.parcel_profile(p, T[0], Td[0]).to('degC')

Basic Skew-T Plotting
---------------------

The Skew-T (log-P) diagram is the standard way to view rawinsonde data. The
y-axis is height in pressure coordinates and the x-axis is temperature. The
y coordinates are plotted on a logarithmic scale and the x coordinate system
is skewed. An explanation of skew-T interpretation is beyond the scope of this
tutorial, but here we will plot one that can be used for analysis or
publication.

The most basic skew-T can be plotted with only five lines of Python.
These lines perform the following tasks:

1. Create a ``Figure`` object and set the size of the figure.

2. Create a ``SkewT`` object

3. Plot the pressure and temperature (note that the pressure,
   the independent variable, is first even though it is plotted on the y-axis).

4. Plot the pressure and dewpoint temperature.

5. Plot the wind barbs at the appropriate pressure using the u and v wind
   components.

    fig = plt.figure(figsize=(9, 9))

    # log scaling in Y, as dictated by the typical meteorological plot
    skew.plot(p, T, 'r', linewidth=2)
    skew.plot(p, Td, 'g', linewidth=2)
    skew.plot_barbs(p, u, v)

Advanced Skew-T Plotting
------------------------

Fiducial lines indicating dry adiabats, moist adiabats, and mixing ratio are
useful when performing further analysis on the Skew-T diagram. Often the
0C isotherm is emphasized and areas of CAPE and CIN are shaded.

Adding a Hodograph
------------------

A hodograph is a polar representation of the wind profile measured by the rawinsonde.
Winds at different levels are plotted as vectors with their tails at the origin, the angle
from the vertical axes representing the direction, and the length representing the speed.
The line plotted on the hodograph is a line connecting the tips of these vectors,
which are not drawn.
