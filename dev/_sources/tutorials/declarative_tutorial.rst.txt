=================================
MetPy Declarative Syntax Tutorial
=================================

The declarative syntax that is a part of the MetPy packaged is designed to aid in simple
data exploration and analysis needs by simplifying the plotting context from typical verbose
Python code. The complexity of data wrangling and plotting are hidden behind the simplified
syntax to allow a lower barrier to investigating your data.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 16-22

Imports
-------

You'll note that the number of imports is smaller due to using the declarative syntax.
There is no need to import Matplotlib or Cartopy to your code as all of that is done
behind the scenes.

Getting Data
------------

Depending on what kind of data you are wanting to plot you'll use either Xarray (for gridded
data), Pandas (for CSV data), or the MetPy METAR parser (for METAR data).

We'll start this tutorial by reading in a gridded dataset using Xarray.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 41-48

    # Open the netCDF file as a xarray Dataset and parse the full dataset
    data = xr.open_dataset(get_test_data('GFS_test.nc', False)).metpy.parse_cf()

Set the date/time of that you desire to plot

.. code-block:: Python

    plot_time = datetime(2010, 10, 26, 12)








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 56-63

Subsetting Data
---------------

MetPy provides wrappers for the usual xarray indexing and selection routines that can handle
quantities with units. For DataArrays, MetPy also allows using the coordinate axis types
mentioned above as aliases for the coordinates. And so, if we wanted data to be just over
the U.S. for plotting purposes

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 63-65

.. code-block:: Python

    ds = data.metpy.sel(lat=slice(70, 10), lon=slice(360 - 150, 360 - 55))








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 66-68

For full details on xarray indexing/selection, see
`xarray's documentation <https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/indexing.html>`_.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 70-78

Calculations
------------

In MetPy 1.0 and later, calculation functions accept Xarray DataArray's as input and the
output a DataArray that can be easily added to an existing Dataset.

As an example, we calculate wind speed from the wind components and add it as a new variable
to our Dataset.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 78-81

.. code-block:: Python

    ds['wind_speed'] = mpcalc.wind_speed(ds['u-component_of_wind_isobaric'],
                                         ds['v-component_of_wind_isobaric'])








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 82-113

Plotting
--------

With that minimal preparation, we are now ready to use the simplified plotting syntax to be
able to plot our data and analyze the meteorological situation.

General Structure

1. Set contour attributes

2. Set map characteristics and collect contours

3. Collect panels and plot

4. Show (or save) the results

Valid Plotting Types for Gridded Data:

- ``ContourPlot()``

- ``FilledContourPlot()``

- ``ImagePlot()``

- ``BarbPlot()``

More complete descriptions of these and other plotting types, as well as the map panel and
panel container classes are at the end of this tutorial.

Let's plot a 300-hPa map with color-filled wind speed, which we calculated and added to
our Dataset above, and geopotential heights over the CONUS.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 115-118

We'll start by setting attributes for contours of Geopotential Heights at 300 hPa.
We need to set at least the data, field, level, and time attributes. We'll set a few others
to have greater control over hour the data is plotted.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 118-130

.. code-block:: Python


    # Set attributes for contours of Geopotential Heights at 300 hPa
    cntr2 = ContourPlot()
    cntr2.data = ds
    cntr2.field = 'Geopotential_height_isobaric'
    cntr2.level = 300 * units.hPa
    cntr2.time = plot_time
    cntr2.contours = list(range(0, 10000, 120))
    cntr2.linecolor = 'black'
    cntr2.linestyle = 'solid'
    cntr2.clabels = True








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 131-136

Now we'll set the attributes for plotting color-filled contours of wind speed at 300 hPa.
Again, the attributes that must be set include data, field, level, and time. We'll also set
a colormap and colorbar to be purposeful for wind speed. Additionally, we'll set the
attribute to change the units from m/s to knots, which is the common plotting units for
wind speed.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 136-148

.. code-block:: Python


    # Set attributes for plotting color-filled contours of wind speed at 300 hPa
    cfill = FilledContourPlot()
    cfill.data = ds
    cfill.field = 'wind_speed'
    cfill.level = 300 * units.hPa
    cfill.time = plot_time
    cfill.contours = list(range(10, 201, 20))
    cfill.colormap = 'BuPu'
    cfill.colorbar = 'horizontal'
    cfill.plot_units = 'knot'








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 149-154

Once we have our contours (and any colorfill plots) set up, we will want to define the map
panel that we'll plot the data on. This is the place where we can set the view extent,
projection of our plot, add map lines like coastlines and states, set a plot title.
One of the key elements is to add the data to the map panel as a list with the plots
attribute.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 154-163

.. code-block:: Python


    # Set the attributes for the map and add our data to the map
    panel = MapPanel()
    panel.area = [-125, -74, 20, 55]
    panel.projection = 'lcc'
    panel.layers = ['states', 'coastline', 'borders']
    panel.title = f'{cfill.level.m}-hPa Heights and Wind Speed at {plot_time}'
    panel.plots = [cfill, cntr2]








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 164-166

Finally we'll collect all the panels to plot on the figure, set the size of the figure,
and ultimately show or save the figure.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 166-172

.. code-block:: Python


    # Set the attributes for the panel and put the panel in the figure
    pc = PanelContainer()
    pc.size = (15, 15)
    pc.panels = [panel]








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 173-174

That's it! What a nice looking map, with relatively simple set of code.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 183-189

Adding Wind Barbs
-----------------

We can easily add wind barbs to the plot we generated above by adding another plot type
and adding it to the panel. The plot type for wind barbs is ``BarbPlot()`` and has its own
set of attributes to control plotting a vector quantity.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 191-193

We start with setting the attributes that we had before for our 300 hPa plot including,
Geopotential Height contours, and color-filled wind speed.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 193-216

.. code-block:: Python


    # Set attributes for contours of Geopotential Heights at 300 hPa

    cntr2.field = 'Geopotential_height_isobaric'
    cntr2.level = 300 * units.hPa
    cntr2.time = plot_time
    cntr2.contours = list(range(0, 10000, 120))
    cntr2.linecolor = 'black'
    cntr2.linestyle = 'solid'
    cntr2.clabels = True

    # Set attributes for plotting color-filled contours of wind speed at 300 hPa
    cfill = FilledContourPlot()
    cfill.data = ds
    cfill.field = 'wind_speed'
    cfill.level = 300 * units.hPa
    cfill.time = plot_time

    cfill.colormap = 'BuPu'
    cfill.colorbar = 'horizontal'
    cfill.plot_units = 'knot'








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 217-220

Now we'll set the attributes for plotting wind barbs, with the required attributes of data,
time, field, and level. The skip attribute is particularly useful for thinning the number of
wind barbs that are plotted on the map. Again we convert to units of knots.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 220-230

.. code-block:: Python


    # Set attributes for plotting wind barbs
    barbs = BarbPlot()

    barbs.level = 300 * units.hPa
    barbs.skip = (3, 3)
    barbs.plot_units = 'knot'

list!

Plot Surface Obs
----------------

We can also plot surface (or upper-air) observations at point locations using the simplified
syntax. Whether it is surface or upper-air data, the ``PlotObs()`` class is what you would
want to use. Then you would add those observations to a map panel and then collect the panels
to plot the figure; similar to what you would do for a gridded plot.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 269-281

Setting of our attributes for plotting observations is pretty straightforward and just needs
to be lists for the variables, and a comparable number of items for plot characteristics that
are specific to the individual fields. For example, the locations around a station plot, the
plot units, and any plotting formats would all need to have the same number of items as the
fields attribute.

Plotting wind bards is done through the vector_field attribute. You can reduce the number
of points plotted (especially important for surface observations) with the ``reduce_points``
attribute.

For a very basic plot of one field, the minimum required attributes are the data, time,
fields, and location attributes.

Detailed Attribute Descriptions
-------------------------------

This final section contains verbose descriptions of the attributes that can be set by the
plot types used in this tutorial.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 325-400

ContourPlot()
-------------

This class is designed to plot contours of gridded data, most commonly model output from the
GFS, NAM, RAP, or other gridded dataset (e.g., NARR).

Attributes:

``data``

This attribute must be set with the variable name that contains the xarray dataset.
(Typically this is the variable ds)

``field``

This attribute must be set with the name of the variable that you want to contour.
For example, to plot the heights of pressure surfaces from the GFS you would use the name
``‘Geopotential_height_isobaric’``

``level``

This attribute sets the level of the data you wish to plot. If it is a pressure level,
then it must be set to a unit bearing value (e.g., 500*units.hPa). If the variable does
not have any vertical levels (e.g., mean sea-level pressure), then the level attribute must
be set to None.

``time``

This attribute must be set with a datetime object, just as with the ``PlotObs()`` class.
To get a forecast hour, you can use the timedelta function from datetime to add the number of
hours into the future you wish to plot. For example, if you wanted the six hour forecast from
the 00 UTC 2 February 2020 model run, then you would set the attribute with:

``datetime(2020, 2, 2, 0) + timedelta(hours=6)``

``contours``

This attribute sets the contour values to be plotted with a list. This can be set manually
with a list of integers in square brackets (e.g., ``[5400, 5460, 5520, 5580, 5640, 5700]``)
or programmatically (e.g., ``list(range(0, 10000, 60))``). The second method is a way to
easily set a contour interval (in this case 60).

``clabel``

This attribute can be set to ``True`` if you desire to have your contours labeled.

``linestyle``

This attribute can be set to make the contours ``‘solid’``, ``‘dashed’``, ``‘dotted’``,
or ``‘dashdot’``. Other linestyles are can be used and are found at:
https://matplotlib.org/3.1.0/gallery/lines_bars_and_markers/linestyles.html

Default is ``‘solid’``.

``linewidth``

This attribute alters the width of the contours (defaults to 1). Setting the value greater
than 1 will yield a thicker contour line.

``linecolor``

This attribute sets the color of the contour lines. Default is ``‘black’``. All colors from
matplotlib are valid: https://matplotlib.org/3.1.0/_images/sphx_glr_named_colors_003.png

``plot_units``

If you want to change the units for plotting purposes, add the string value of the units
desired. For example, if you want to plot temperature in Celsius, then set this attribute
to ``‘degC’``.

``scale``

This attribute will scale the field by multiplying by the scale. For example, to
scale vorticity to be whole values for contouring you could set the scale to 1e5, such that
the data values will be multiplied by 10^5.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 403-429

FilledContourPlot()
-------------------

Works very similarly to ``ContourPlot()``, except that contours are filled using a colormap
between contour values. All attributes for ``ContourPlot()`` work for color-filled plots,
except for linestyle, linecolor, and linewidth. Additionally, there are the following
attributes that work for color-filling:

Attributes:

``colormap``

This attribute is used to set a valid colormap from either Matplotlib or MetPy:
Matplotlib Colormaps: https://matplotlib.org/3.1.1/gallery/color/colormap_reference.html
MetPy Colormaps: https://unidata.github.io/MetPy/v1.0/api/generated/metpy.plots.ctables.html

``colorbar``

This attribute can be set to ``‘vertical’`` or ``‘horizontal’``, which is the location the
colorbar will be plotted on the panel.

``image_range``

A set of values indicating the minimum and maximum for the data being plotted. This
attribute should be set as ``(min_value, max_value)``, where min_value and max_value are
numeric values.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 431-451

PanelContainer()
----------------

Attributes:

``size``

The size of the figure in inches (e.g., (10, 8))

``panels``

A list collecting the panels to be plotted in the figure.

``show``

Show the plot

``save``

Save the figure using the Matplotlib arguments/keyword arguments

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 453-490

MapPanel()
----------

Attributes:

``layout``

The Matplotlib layout of the figure. For a single panel figure the setting should be
``(1, 1, 1)``

``projection``

The projection can be set with the name of a default projection (``‘lcc’``, ``‘mer’``, or
``‘ps’``) or it can be set to a Cartopy projection.

``layers``

This attribute will add map layers to identify boundaries or features to plot on the map.
Valid layers are ``'borders'``, ``'coastline'``, ``'states'``, ``'lakes'``, ``'land'``,
``'ocean'``, ``'rivers'``, ``'counties'``.

``area``

This attribute sets the geographical area of the panel. This can be set with a predefined
name of an area including all US state postal abbreviations (e.g., ``‘us’``, ``‘natl’``,
``‘in’``, ``‘il’``, ``‘wi’``, ``‘mi’``, etc.) or a tuple value that corresponds to
longitude/latitude box based on the projection of the map with the format
``(west-most longitude, east-most longitude, south-most latitude, north-most latitude)``.
This tuple defines a box from the lower-left to the upper-right corner.

``title``

This attribute sets a title for the panel.

``plots``

A list collecting the observations to be plotted in the panel.

This plot class is used to add wind barbs to the plot with the following

Attributes:

``data``

This attribute must be set to the variable that contains the vector components to be plotted.

``field``

This attribute is a list of the vector components to be plotted. For the typical
meteorological case it would be the ``[‘u-component’, ‘v-component’]``.

``time``

This attribute should be set to a datetime object, the same as for all other declarative
classes.

``barblength``

This attribute sets the length of the wind barbs. The default value is based on the
font size.

``color``

This attribute sets the color of the wind barbs, which can be any Matplotlib color.
Default color is ``‘black’``.

``earth_relative``

This attribute can be set to False if the vector components are grid relative (e.g., for NAM
or NARR output)

``pivot``

This attribute can be set to a string value about where the wind barb will pivot relative to
the grid point. Possible values include ``‘tip’`` or ``‘middle’``. Default is ``‘middle’``.

PlotObs()
---------

This class is used to plot point observations from the surface or upper-air.

Attributes:

``data``

This attribute needs to be set to the DataFrame variable containing the fields that you
desire to plot.

``fields``

This attribute is a list of variable names from your DataFrame that you desire to plot at the
given locations around the station model.

``level``

For a surface plot this needs to be set to None.

``time``

This attribute needs to be set to subset your data attribute for the time of the observations
to be plotted. This needs to be a datetime object.

``locations``

This attribute sets the location of the fields to be plotted around the surface station
model. The default location is center ``(‘C’)``

``time_window``

This attribute allows you to define a window for valid observations (e.g., 15 minutes on
either side of the datetime object setting. This is important for surface data since actual
observed times are not all exactly on the hour. If multiple observations exist in the defined
window, the most recent observations is retained for plotting purposes.

``formats``

This attribute sets a formatter for text or plotting symbols around the station model. For
example, plotting mean sea-level pressure is done in a three-digit code and a formatter can
be used to achieve that on the station plot.

MSLP Formatter: ``lambda v: format(10 * v, '.0f')[-3:]``

For plotting symbols use the available MetPy options through their name. Valid symbol formats
are ``'current_weather'``, ``'sky_cover'``, ``'low_clouds'``, ``'mid_clouds'``,
``'high_clouds'``, and ``'pressure_tendency'``.

``colors``

This attribute can change the color of the plotted observation. Default is ``‘black’``.
Acceptable colors are those available through Matplotlib:

``vector_field``

This attribute can be set to a list of wind component values for plotting
(e.g., ``[‘uwind’, ‘vwind’]``)

``vector_field_color``

Same as colors except only controls the color of the wind barbs. Default is ``‘black’``.

``reduce_points``

This attribute can be set to a real number to reduce the number of stations that are plotted.
Default value is zero (e.g., no points are removed from the plot).
