=====================
Hydrostatic Thickness
=====================

Use functions from `metpy.calc` as well as pint's unit support to perform calculations.

The code below uses example data from our test suite to calculate the hydrostatic thickness
between the surface and 500-hPa level for the provided sounding data.

Upper air data can be obtained using the siphon package, but for this example we will use
some of MetPy's sample data.
