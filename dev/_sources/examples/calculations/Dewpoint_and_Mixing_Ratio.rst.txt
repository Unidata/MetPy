Dewpoint and Mixing Ratio
=========================

Use functions from `metpy.calc` as well as pint's unit support to perform calculations.

The code below converts the mixing ratio value into
a value for vapor pressure assuming both 1000mb and 850mb ambient air
pressure values. It also demonstrates converting the resulting dewpoint
temperature to degrees Fahrenheit.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 15-18

.. code-block:: default

    import metpy.calc as mpcalc
    from metpy.units import units








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 19-20

Create a test value of mixing ratio in grams per kilogram

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 20-23

.. code-block:: default

    mixing = 10 * units('g/kg')
    print(mixing)





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none

    10.0 gram / kilogram




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 24-26

Now throw that value with units into the function to calculate
the corresponding vapor pressure, given a surface pressure of 1000 mb

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 26-29

.. code-block:: default

    e = mpcalc.vapor_pressure(1000. * units.mbar, mixing)

Take the raw vapor pressure and throw into the dewpoint function

Now do the same thing for 850 mb, approximately the pressure of Denver
