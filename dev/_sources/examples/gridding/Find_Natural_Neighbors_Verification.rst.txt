Find Natural Neighbors Verification
===================================

Finding natural neighbors in a triangulation

A triangle is a natural neighbor of a point if that point is within a circumscribed
circle ("circumcircle") containing the triangle.

Since finding natural neighbors already calculates circumcenters, return
that information for later use.

The key of the neighbors dictionary refers to the test point index, and the list of integers
are the triangles that are natural neighbors of that particular test point.

Since point 4 is far away from the triangulation, it has no natural neighbors.
Point 3 is at the confluence of several triangles so it has many natural neighbors.
