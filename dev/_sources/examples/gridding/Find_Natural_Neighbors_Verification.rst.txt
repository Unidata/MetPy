Find Natural Neighbors Verification
===================================

Finding natural neighbors in a triangulation

A triangle is a natural neighbor of a point if that point is within a circumradius of the
circumcenter of a circumscribed circle containing the triangle.



.. code-block:: python

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import numpy as np
    from scipy.spatial import Delaunay

    from metpy.interpolate.geometry import find_natural_neighbors

    # Create test observations, test points, and plot the triangulation and points.
    gx, gy = np.meshgrid(np.arange(0, 20, 4), np.arange(0, 20, 4))
    pts = np.vstack([gx.ravel(), gy.ravel()]).T
    tri = Delaunay(pts)

    fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(15, 10))
    for i, inds in enumerate(tri.simplices):
        pts = tri.points[inds]
        x, y = np.vstack((pts, pts[0])).T
        ax.plot(x, y)
        ax.annotate(i, xy=(np.mean(x), np.mean(y)))

    test_points = np.array([[2, 2], [5, 10], [12, 13.4], [12, 8], [20, 20]])

    for i, (x, y) in enumerate(test_points):
        ax.plot(x, y, 'k.', markersize=6)
        ax.annotate('test ' + str(i), xy=(x, y))

Since finding natural neighbors already calculates circumcenters and circumradii, return
that information for later use.

The key of the neighbors dictionary refers to the test point index, and the list of integers
are the triangles that are natural neighbors of that particular test point.

Since point 4 is far away from the triangulation, it has no natural neighbors.
Point 3 is at the confluence of several triangles so it has many natural neighbors.



.. code-block:: python

    neighbors, tri_info = find_natural_neighbors(tri, test_points)
    print(neighbors)





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none

    {0: [0, 1], 1: [24, 25], 2: [16, 17, 30, 31], 3: [18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 26, 27], 4: []}


We can then use the information in tri_info later.

The dictionary key is the index of a particular triangle in the Delaunay triangulation data
structure. 'cc' is that triangle's circumcenter, and 'r' is the radius of the circumcircle
containing that triangle.



.. code-block:: python

    fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(15, 10))
    for i, inds in enumerate(tri.simplices):
        pts = tri.points[inds]
        x, y = np.vstack((pts, pts[0])).T
        ax.plot(x, y)
        ax.annotate(i, xy=(np.mean(x), np.mean(y)))

    # Using circumcenter and radius information from tri_info, plot circumcircles and
    # circumcenters for each triangle.
    for _idx, item in tri_info.items():
        ax.plot(item['cc'][0], item['cc'][1], 'k.', markersize=5)
        circ = plt.Circle(item['cc'], item['r'], edgecolor='k', facecolor='none',
                          transform=fig.axes[0].transData)
        ax.add_artist(circ)

    ax.set_aspect('equal', 'datalim')

    plt.show()
