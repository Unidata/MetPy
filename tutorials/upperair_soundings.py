===========================
Upper Air Sounding Tutorial
===========================

Upper air analysis is a staple of many synoptic and mesoscale analysis
problems. In this tutorial we will gather weather balloon data, plot it,
perform a series of thermodynamic calculations, and summarize the results.
To learn more about the Skew-T diagram and its use in weather analysis and
forecasting, checkout `this <http://homes.comet.ucar.edu/~alanbol/aws-tr-79-006.pdf>`_
air weather service guide.

# Getting Data
# ------------
#
# We will download data from the
# `University of Wyoming sounding data page <http://weather.uwyo.edu/upperair/sounding.html>`_
# , which has an extensive archive of data available, as well as current data.
#
# In this case, we will download the sounding data from the Veterans Day
# tornado outbreak in 2002 by passing a ``datetime`` object and station name to the
# ``get_upper_air_data`` function.

dataset = get_upper_air_data(datetime(2002, 11, 11, 0), 'BNA')

# We can view the fields available in the dataset. We will create some simple
# variables to make the rest of the code more concise.

# Thermodynamic Calculations
# --------------------------
#
# Often times we will want to calculate some thermodynamic parameters of a
# sounding. The MetPy calc module has many such calculations already implemented!
#
# * **Lifting Condensation Level (LCL)** - The level at which an air parcel's
#   relative humidity becomes 100% when lifted along a dry adiabatic path.
# * **Parcel Path** - Path followed by a hypothetical parcel of air, beginning
#   at the surface temperature/pressure and rising dry adiabatically until
#   reaching the LCL, then rising moist adiabatially.

# Calculate the LCL
lcl_pressure, lcl_temperature = mpcalc.lcl(p[0], T[0], Td[0])

print(lcl_pressure, lcl_temperature)

# Calculate the parcel profile.
parcel_prof = mpcalc.parcel_profile(p, T[0], Td[0]).to('degC')

# Basic Skew-T Plotting
# ---------------------
#
# The Skew-T (log-P) diagram is the standard way to view rawinsonde data. The
# y-axis is height in pressure coordinates and the x-axis is temperature. The
# y coordinates are plotted on a logarithmic scale and the x coordinate system
# is skewed. An explanation of skew-T interpretation is beyond the scope of this
# tutorial, but here we will plot one that can be used for analysis or
# publication.
#
# The most basic skew-T can be plotted with only five lines of Python.
# These lines perform the following tasks:
#
# 1. Create a ``Figure`` object and set the size of the figure.
#
# 2. Create a ``SkewT`` object
#
# 3. Plot the pressure and temperature (note that the pressure,
#    the independent variable, is first even though it is plotted on the y-axis).
#
# 4. Plot the pressure and dewpoint temperature.
#
# 5. Plot the wind barbs at the appropriate pressure using the u and v wind
#    components.

# Create a new figure. The dimensions here give a good aspect ratio
fig = plt.figure(figsize=(9, 9))
skew = SkewT(fig)

# Plot the data using normal plotting functions, in this case using
# log scaling in Y, as dictated by the typical meteorological plot
skew.plot(p, T, 'r', linewidth=2)
skew.plot(p, Td, 'g', linewidth=2)
skew.plot_barbs(p, u, v)

# Show the plot
plt.show()

##########################################################################
# Advanced Skew-T Plotting
# ------------------------
#
# Fiducial lines indicating dry adiabats, moist adiabats, and mixing ratio are
# useful when performing further analysis on the Skew-T diagram. Often the
# 0C isotherm is emphasized and areas of CAPE and CIN are shaded.

# Create a new figure. The dimensions here give a good aspect ratio
fig = plt.figure(figsize=(9, 9))
skew = SkewT(fig, rotation=30)

# Plot the data using normal plotting functions, in this case using
# log scaling in Y, as dictated by the typical meteorological plot
skew.plot(p, T, 'r')
skew.plot(p, Td, 'g')
skew.plot_barbs(p, u, v)
skew.ax.set_ylim(1000, 100)
skew.ax.set_xlim(-40, 60)

# Plot LCL temperature as black dot
skew.plot(lcl_pressure, lcl_temperature, 'ko', markerfacecolor='black')

# Plot the parcel profile as a black line
skew.plot(p, parcel_prof, 'k', linewidth=2)

# Color regions of CAPE and CIN (the area between the actual temperature and
# the parcel path).
skew.shade_cin(p, T, parcel_prof)
skew.shade_cape(p, T, parcel_prof)

# Plot a zero degree isotherm
l = skew.ax.axvline(0, color='c', linestyle='--', linewidth=2)

# Add the relevant special lines
skew.plot_dry_adiabats()
skew.plot_moist_adiabats()
skew.plot_mixing_lines()

# Show the plot
plt.show()

##########################################################################
# Adding a Hodograph
# ------------------
#
# A hodograph is a polar representation of the wind profile measured by the rawinsonde.
# Winds at different levels are plotted as vectors with their tails at the origin, the angle
# from the vertical axes representing the direction, and the length representing the speed.
# The line plotted on the hodograph is a line connecting the tips of these vectors,
# which are not drawn.

# Create a new figure. The dimensions here give a good aspect ratio
fig = plt.figure(figsize=(9, 9))
skew = SkewT(fig, rotation=30)

# Plot the data using normal plotting functions, in this case using
# log scaling in Y, as dictated by the typical meteorological plot
skew.plot(p, T, 'r')
skew.plot(p, Td, 'g')
skew.plot_barbs(p, u, v)
skew.ax.set_ylim(1000, 100)
skew.ax.set_xlim(-40, 60)

# Plot LCL as black dot
skew.plot(lcl_pressure, lcl_temperature, 'ko', markerfacecolor='black')

# Plot the parcel profile as a black line
skew.plot(p, parcel_prof, 'k', linewidth=2)

# Color regions of CAPE and CIN (the area between the actual temperature and
# the parcel path).
skew.shade_cin(p, T, parcel_prof)
skew.shade_cape(p, T, parcel_prof)

# Plot a zero degree isotherm
l = skew.ax.axvline(0, color='c', linestyle='--', linewidth=2)

# Add the relevant special lines
skew.plot_dry_adiabats()
skew.plot_moist_adiabats()
skew.plot_mixing_lines()

# Create a hodograph
# Create an inset axes object that is 40% width and height of the
# figure and put it in the upper right hand corner.
ax_hod = inset_axes(skew.ax, '40%', '40%', loc=1)
h = Hodograph(ax_hod, component_range=80.)
h.add_grid(increment=20)
h.plot_colormapped(u, v, np.hypot(u, v))  # Plot a line colored by wind speed

# Show the plot
