# MetPy Tutorials

Welcome to the MetPy tutorials! These tutorials are designed to help you get started with using MetPy for meteorological data analysis and visualization. Whether you're a beginner looking to explore the basics or an experienced user seeking advanced techniques, these tutorials will guide you through various aspects of MetPy.

## Purpose

The purpose of these tutorials is to provide hands-on examples and explanations to help you learn how to use MetPy effectively for your meteorological data analysis tasks. Each tutorial focuses on a specific aspect of MetPy, gradually building your understanding and skills as you progress through them.

## Getting Started

If this is your first time using MetPy head over to the [installation guide](https://unidata.github.io/MetPy/latest/userguide/installguide.html) to make sure the required dependencies have been installed.

## Tutorials by Difficulty Level

### Beginner Level

1. **Area Tutorial**: Learn how to use predefined areas with MetPy.

2. **Declarative Tutorial**: MetPy's declarative syntax simplifies data exploration and analysis by streamlining plotting in Python, hiding complexity to make data investigation more accessible.
 
3.  **Unit Tutorial**: Learn how to work with units within Metpy!

### Intermediate Level

1. **Upper Air Soundings**: Upper air analysis is a staple of many synoptic and mesoscale analysis problems. In this tutorial we will gather weather balloon data, plot it, perform a series of thermodynamic calculations, and summarize the results.

2. **xarray with MetPy Tutorial**: This tutorial demonstrates how to work with xarray, a powerful Python package for labeled arrays and datasets. MetPy seamlessly integrates with xarray's data model, offering convenient methods and properties for coordinate, coordinate reference system, and unit operations. 
### Advanced Level

1. **Advanced Tutorials Coming Soon**

The [Examples Gallery](https://unidata.github.io/MetPy/latest/examples/index.html) has more examples of what else you can create with MetPy!

Unit conversions can still get the best of us and have caused more than one major technical disaster, including the crash and complete loss of the $327 million Mars Climate Orbiter.">

    <div class="sphx-glr-thumbcontainer" tooltip="When plotting your data on a map you want to be able to plot the data in a useful area and with a projection that would match the areal extent well. Within MetPy we have generated more than 400 pre-defined areas that also have associated projections, which you can use to make quick plots over regions of interest with minimal effort on your part. While these were intended to be used with the MetPy declarative syntax, these areas and projections are now accessible for any use of plotting data on a map using Cartopy.">
