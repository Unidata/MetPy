    Parameters
    ----------
    ts : array_like
         The time series from which you wish to find the perturbation
         time series (perturbation from the mean).

def tke(u, v, w, perturbation=False, axis=-1):
    r"""Compute turbulence kinetic energy.

    Compute the turbulence kinetic energy (e) from the time series of the
    velocity components.

    Parameters
    ----------
    u : array_like
        The wind component along the x-axis
    v : array_like
        The wind component along the y-axis
    w : array_like
        The wind component along the z-axis

    perturbation : {False, True}, optional
                   True if the `u`, `v`, and `w` components of wind speed
                   supplied to the function are perturbation velocities.
                   If False, perturbation velocities will be calculated by
                   removing the mean value from each component.

    Returns
    -------
    array_like
        The corresponding turbulence kinetic energy value

def kinematic_flux(vel, b, perturbation=False, axis=-1):
    r"""Compute the kinematic flux from two time series.

    Compute the kinematic flux from the time series of two variables `vel`
    and b. Note that to be a kinematic flux, at least one variable must be
    a component of velocity.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vel : array_like
        A component of velocity

    b : array_like
        May be a component of velocity or a scalar variable (e.g. Temperature)

    perturbation : bool, optional
        `True` if the `vel` and `b` variables are perturbations. If `False`, perturbations
        will be calculated by removing the mean value from each variable. Defaults to `False`.

    Returns
    -------
    array_like
        The corresponding kinematic flux

    Other Parameters
    ----------------
    axis : int, optional
           The index of the time axis, along which the calculations will be
           performed. Defaults to -1

    Notes
    -----
    A kinematic flux is computed as

    .. math:: \overline{u^{\prime} s^{\prime}}

    where at the prime notation denotes perturbation variables, and at least
    one variable is perturbation velocity. For example, the vertical kinematic
    momentum flux (two velocity components):

    .. math:: \overline{u^{\prime} w^{\prime}}

    or the vertical kinematic heat flux (one velocity component, and one
    scalar):

    .. math:: \overline{w^{\prime} T^{\prime}}

    If perturbation variables are passed into this function (i.e.
    `perturbation` is True), the kinematic flux is computed using the equation
    above.

    However, the equation above can be rewritten as

    .. math:: \overline{us} - \overline{u}~\overline{s}

    which is computationally more efficient. This is how the kinematic flux
    is computed in this function if `perturbation` is False.

def friction_velocity(u, w, v=None, perturbation=False, axis=-1):
    r"""Compute the friction velocity from the time series of velocity components.

    Compute the friction velocity from the time series of the x, z,
    and optionally y, velocity components.

    Parameters
    ----------
    u : array_like
        The wind component along the x-axis
    w : array_like
        The wind component along the z-axis
    v : array_like, optional
        The wind component along the y-axis.

    perturbation : {False, True}, optional
                   True if the `u`, `w`, and `v` components of wind speed
                   supplied to the function are perturbation velocities.
                   If False, perturbation velocities will be calculated by
                   removing the mean value from each component.

    Returns
    -------
    array_like
        The corresponding friction velocity

    Other Parameters
    ----------------
    axis : int
           The index of the time axis. Default is -1

                     vertical kinematic momentum flux(es) used in the
                     computation of the friction velocity.

    Notes
    -----
    The Friction Velocity is computed as:

    :math: \overline{v^{\prime}w^{\prime}}
    are the x-component and y-components of the vertical kinematic momentum
    flux, respectively. If the optional v component of velocity is not
    supplied to the function, the computation of the friction velocity is
    reduced to

    .. math:: u_{*} = \sqrt[4]{\left(\overline{u^{\prime}w^{\prime}}\right)^2}
