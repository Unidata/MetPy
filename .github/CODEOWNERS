# These owners will be the default owners for everything in the repo.
# Unless a later match takes precedence, global owners

# Order is important; the last matching pattern takes the most precedence.
# When someone opens a pull request that only modifies specified file types, only
# that owner will be requested for a review, not the global owner(s).
# Email addresses can be used as well as GitHub user names.
